Classroom Upgrade Process Planning Time-Line
============================================

REVISED: April, 2009

January 1 - April 1
===================

Should a theme or priority be proposed, the COUC will convene prior to January 31 approve or deny the proposal.

Should a priority or theme be approved by the COUC, all involved departments will develop rough cost estimates to determine if the theme or priority is feasible with available funding. These estimates are to be developed by March 31, 2009 and distributed to all COUC members.

May 1 - August 31
=================

The Provost solicits classroom upgrade requests by memorandum dated May 1, 2009 Memorandum announces any special priorities or themes for classroom upgrades/improvements and communicates written guidance (developed by the Classroom Coordinator in coordination with the ETC Director and the Vice President for Administrative & Information Services) to the Deans; Associate Vice President for Administrative Services; ETC Director; Facilities Management Director; University Architect, and other areas involved with the Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 Classroom Upgrade Program.

* Priorities/Themes may focus on general education classrooms, particular size classrooms, up to some number of rooms per College, or no particular theme/focus. Based upon resource constraints, the Provost guidance will specify some monetary limit on the funding allocation per College and/or number of rooms that can be nominated by each College.
* Annual guidance will include the requirement to submit candidate rooms on a Classroom Upgrade Request Form (one for each room) to the Classroom Coordinator by August 31, 2009. Each academic unit will identify the name of a classroom upgrade contact person and will be required to prioritize its submission if more than one classroom is nominated for upgrade.
* Director of the Facilities Management and University Architect will identify suitable classrooms for infrastructure upgrading to meet life safety, accessibility or building code requirements.
* Classroom Coordinator assists in the development of each College classroom upgrade request proposal and helps guide the feasibility of the respective proposals by meeting in each candidate room, reviewing all the specifics with the academic unit contact person and any faculty member who is involved. Failure to meet with the Classroom Coordinator in the room being proposed, at least 30 days before the August 31, 2009, will be cause for rejection of the proposal(s). At the conclusion of this meeting, the Classroom Coordinator will provide recommendations and provide the initial signoff required for proposal submission.
* July 1, 2009, Classroom Upgrade SCUF funding for FY ’10 upgrade process is deposited in ETC SCUF-Classroom Technologies budget FOPAL E02033 022017 011
* Classroom Coordinator must receive FY 2010 Classroom Upgrade Request proposals by August 31, 2009 from academic units for installation during the following summer.
* Deadline for submission of requests to the Classroom Coordinator is August 31, 2009. Any request received after that date will be returned to the request originator for  consideration in the next year’s request cycle.
