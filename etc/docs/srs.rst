This training will provide users with a hands-on demonstration of eInstruction’s classic CPS for PC and their newest software release, CPS for PowerPoint.

Word of WARNING!
================

September 25, 2006

The ETC was notified recently by a concerned parent that her son had been contacted via telephone by someone verifying his online eInstruction transaction. We were initially concerned that this could have been a “phishing” scam but that was not the case.

This student had used a check to pay online which is now possible with some banks. It was not eInstruction who contacted the student, but rather, Telecheck, a national check verification company. Telecheck simply verified the student’s checking account and routing numbers (numbers they had and read back to him minus one digit) and no sensitive data was requested. This was a legitimate call from Telecheck, and there was no problem. However, because we were made aware of this incident, and initially feared the worst, we felt it would be wise to place a reminder on our site regarding release of sensitive information.

As with all dealings, students should take every measure possible to safeguard their sensitive data; social security numbers, credit card numbers etc. This data should only be released to known and verified entities. Also, as a reminder, eInstruction does not solicit financial or personal information from students via telephone or e-mail. Below is an e-mail statement from eInstruction’s President & CEO.

Dear Missouri State students, faculty & staff,

eInstruction doesn’t keep credit card information on our servers and we instruct our tech support folks to never write down a credit card number if they are assisting a student.  Our policy is to never call a student to seek credit card information, but to have students call us if they need reimbursement of the enrollment code.
 
Regards,
Darrell Ward, PhD

Most Common SRS Problems
========================

August 31, 2006

While the implementation of the eInstruction Student Response System (SRS) on the Missouri State University campus this fall has gone smoothly, there have been several issues which have arisen that have a common theme. The problem solution chart below may assist you resolving some of the most common issues encountered.

Symptom
-------

Student’s transponder pads continually display “joining” but never join class session.

Possible Causes & Solutions
---------------------------

(No one in the class can join)

.. Cause:: Instructor forgot to choose correct class when starting polling.

.. Solution:: Close CPS session, select question mode, select correct class from pull-down menu.

.. Cause:: Receiver is unplugged or missing.

.. Solution:: Trace USB ports and ensure that there is one going to the CPS receiver and that the unit is lit and displaying a red LED number. If receiver is there but not connected plug unto an available USB port. If the receiver is missing contact the ETC at 836-5778.

(Some students are unable to join the class, but others are)

.. Cause:: Student(s) have not enrolled their transponders in your class.

.. Solution:: Ensure that students were given and used the correct class key code. Students then must go to the eInstruction web site www.einstruction.com select the “student” option at the top of the page, select Missouri State University from the pull-down menu and then log into their account and select “register for a class” NOTE: Many students believe that once they have registered their transponders that they completed the entire registration process, this only creates their eInstruction account, they must then register their transponder in each class they will be using the system in using the class key code given to them by their instructors.

.. Cause:: Student may have a defective transponder pad.

.. Solution:: Student should contact eInstruction technical support at 1-888-333-4988 for RMA. Students will then need to return their transponder pad and RMA form to the place of purchase for a new unit. NOTE: Students obtaining a replacement transponder pad MUST log into their eInstruction account and select “change” next to the serial number listed on their account, this will associate any classes which the defective transponder was registered in to the new transponder pad.

SRS & the Bookstore

Mark Brixey, MSU Bookstore Director forwarded the following policy regarding returns of unused and defective SRS transponder pads “clickers”.

1. Any UNOPENED responder is eligible for a refund.
2. If the responder HAS been opened, but NO ATTEMPT has been made to ACTIVATE it, the responder is eligible for refund.
3. If the responder has been opened and the student had ANY trouble activating it, the STUDENT needs to call the Technical Support number.  If the responder is truly defective, the Tech Support folks will provide the student with a form to exchange it with us.  (We NEED the form to get credit for bad responders from the company so NO EXCHANGES without the form.)

eInstruction Student Technical Support Line 888-333-4988

Any questions regarding this return policy should be referred to Mark Brixey.

July 12, 2006

The Educational Technology Center (ETC) and Computer Services has completed the final technical evaluation stage of the Student Response System (SRS) pilot program which was conducted on Campus during the spring ’06 semester. On March 13, 2006 Jeff Morrissey, Director of Computer Services granted approval to deploy the eInstruction Radio frequency (RF) CPS SRS for the Fall '06 semester.

This approval was granted on the condition that if these systems were to create a level of interference such that the Campus WiFi signal was degraded to an unacceptable level, that the ETC and Computer Services would have to re-evaluate these systems. While there is no doubt that RF SRS systems running at 2.4GHz will cause some interference, the levels monitored and experienced at other institutions who have done large scale deployment of the eInstruction Radio frequency (RF) CPS SRS and that have far greater WiFi coverage than MSU have indicated that the effect is negligible, as such, we do not expect any problem in the future. The eInstruction system is now the "campus standard", and as such, is the only RF SRS in the 2.4GHz range that is authorized for use on the campus of Missouri State. All other 2.4GHz and 5 GHz devices must adhere to the University's policy regarding these frequencies below:

"The 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum are institutional resources that must be governed appropriately. Administrators of wireless networks that use these radio frequencies must centrally register their network's frequency. Additionally, devices interfering with a wireless network may be disabled, upon review. This coordination helps minimize interference problems between wireless networks and other devices using radio frequencies."

What's next; Faculty who plan to use SRS during Fall '06 MUST complete this MSU SRS Adoption Form (this form is a Microsoft Word document). Once completed this form must be sent to Butch Holland of eInstruction. Doing so will allow eInstruction to setup a class registration key account for each faculty member. Please cc David Caravella, ETC Manager on your e-mail to Butch Holland to assist us in tracking the numbers of SRS "clickers" being used on campus. While Butch will be in contact with the Bookstore regarding the number of "clickers" you indicated on your form, please don't forget to let the Bookstore know about use of them in your course.

Faculty planning to use the system will need to attend one training session to learn about using eInstruction SRS. Even faculty who were part of the pilot must attend this training, which will provide you with valuable information about using all the "online features" of the system that were not part of the pilot program. The following training sessions are still available:

August 14, 2006 [note]_

* Session 1: 10:00am - 11:30am
* Session 2: 2:00pm - 3:30pm

Location: All sessions held in Meyer Library 205

August 17, 2006 [note]_

* Session 1: 10:00am - 11:30am
* Session 2: 2:00pm - 3:30pm

Location: All sessions held in Meyer Library 205

.. [note] Butch will be here all day these days, if you cannot make any one of the scheduled training sessions he may be available for a one-on-one training opportunity. This would need to be scheduled in advance through David Caravella x65959.

Though not required, we’d ask that you please contact the ETC at 417-836-5778 to pre-register for these classes. If you have any questions please contact David Caravella.
