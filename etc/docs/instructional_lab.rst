In July of 2008, we set out to do something nobody on campus had done before: implement a Mac lab that ran Windows on the same machines. The all-in-one Gateway PCs that were in the room were starting to show their age, and we needed greater flexibility for the array of classes that were being taught in the classroom.

Enter the new iMac. Since the advent of the Intel processor in Apple's entire computer lineup, Windows can now be installed on any Mac. And that's just what we've done. Utilizing `Bootpicker <http://apple.com/education/it-professionals/bootpicker/>`_ for Mac/Windows selection, we've set up the first cross-platform computer lab on campus. It's as easy to use as it is functional and versatile.
