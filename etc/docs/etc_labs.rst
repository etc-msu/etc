Our Multimedia Lab on the 2nd floor of Meyer Library strives to meet our patrons' specialized needs, and our Multimedia Technology Specialist, Benjamin Kreeger, works to further the lab's abilities and assist those using it.  If you're needing tools like the Adobe Creative Suite, Apple iLife'09, or Final Cut Studio, or if you require the use of flatbed scanners or even a quiet room with a microphone, we've got that.  Benjamin and the dedicated staff of the Multimedia Lab Help Desk can make sure that whatever you're wanting to create, enhance, or experience, our Mac and Windows computers can help you achieve that and more.
