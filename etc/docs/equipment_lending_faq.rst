**Frequently Asked Questions**
          **Q: Is there a charge for the use of your equipment?**
A: No. The equipment in the ETC inventory is for academic use only. This use has no charge associated with it.

**Q: Does the ETC charge late fees?**

A: Yes. Patrons are asked when they will return equipment at the time of reservation or checkout. Patrons are expected to return equipment when scheduled. Not doing so will incur a late fine. Many pieces of equipment in the inventory are in great demand. This policy ensures that equipment is available for other patrons when they have reserved. If needed, you can usually extend your order. However, you must call our main office at 836-5778 to inquire about extending.

**Q: I’m a student. Do I need a signed permission form, and where do I get one?**

A: Yes. All students, including graduate assistants are required to have a signed permission form before checking out equipment from ETC. Forms can be obtained from the ETC’s main office in Library 202 or the Equipment Lending area Library 003 Forms are also available from the Center’s web site at: http://www.missouristate.edu/etc

**Q: Is there a minimum lead time for making Equipment Lending?**
A: Yes. ETC requires an one day notice for pickups.
**Q: I need a technician for my event. Even if the event is on a weekend, is a technician available and how do I request one?**

A: You may request a technician at the time that you reserve your equipment. All requests for technicians are done on a case-by-case basis depending on availability.  There is a charge for a technician based on the hourly rate of available/necessary staffing for all events held outside of the ETC Equipment Lending & Delivery area’s normal business hours (Monday - Friday 7:30 a.m.- 5:30 p.m.).
**Q: Is any of your old equipment for sale?**

A: No, not directly through the ETC. All surplus equipment, by state law has to be sold at auction. Auctions are conducted by Missouri State University Property Control. To find out dates and locations, please contact them at 417-836-7633.

**Q: My event occurs over the weekend; are you open for pickup or return of equipment?**

A: No. We close at 5 p.m. on Friday and re-open at 7:30 a.m. on Monday. You are responsible for storing and using the equipment between those times. 

**Q: My event happens over the weekend; I understand your offices are closed, however, the Library is open, can I pickup or return equipment at the Circulation Desk?**

A: No. While the ETC is located in the Library it is not part of the Library. The Library Circulation Desk cannot checkout or receive equipment.

**Q: It’s raining…. will you still deliver to my class?** 

A: Yes, we deliver in all kinds of weather unless it is severe. 

**Q: It’s raining…. I am scheduled to pickup equipment from ETC is there a cover available so it doesn’t get wet?**

A: Yes, we do have cart covers that cover most of our carts.

**Q: Does a VHS or Mini DV tape come with the video camera I’m checking out?**

A: No. As a convenience, the ETC main office attempts to maintain a limited number of tapes for sale.  It is however, advisable that you purchase the tape you need from the Bookstore or any other source.

**Q: I was hoping the video camera I checked out from ETC would be smaller; why is it so large?**

A: The digital video cameras in the ETC’s inventory are industrial grade cameras as opposed to the small consumer grade cameras. Because of the service duty of our checkout equipment we must use these heavy-duty units.

**Q: I need to record a video and ultimately need to have it in DVD format, how do I accomplish this?**

A: You can checkout a Mini-DV camcorder and firewire cable from the ETC to record your presentation. You can then take your Mini DV tape and camcorder to the open Multi Media Lab on the 2nd floor of the Meyer Library. With the camcorder and firewire cable, you can transfer your Mini-DV to iMovie and iDVD on the Apple iMac workstations in the lab. While lab assistants can provide some guidance, the lab is self-service. There are step-by-step iMovie and iDVD video tutorials located on the desktop of the iMac workstations. Please contact the multimedia lab helpdesk at 836-6198 for more information.

**Q: I have an Apple laptop and want to hook it up to the projector I checkout from you. What do I need?**

A: There are 5 different adaptors that Apple has used for their VGA ports. It is advisable you bring you Mac laptop with you when you come to pick-up the projector to make sure you get the right adaptor.

**Q: What size projection screens you have?**

A: We have three sizes: 50 x 50 (4 ft.), 70 x 70 (6 ft.) and 96 x 96 (8 ft.)  We also have a 10 ½ x 14 ft. box screen.

**Q: Can I extend an order for some equipment I have borrowed?**

A: You can usually extend your order. However, you must call our main office at 836-5778 to inquire about extending.
