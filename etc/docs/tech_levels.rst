Classroom Technology Levels and equipment
-----------------------------------------

The Educational Technology Center with the approval of the appropriate academic and administrative bodies has developed a set of standards for classroom technology installations on the campus of Missouri State University. 

The 3 levels outlined to the right are the most common installations found on the campus. While these are the established standard, variations to these can be permissible provided the change is warranted and feasible. Note any requested variation to established standards must be done in consultation with the Classroom Coordinator, `David Caravella <mailto:davidcaravella@missouristate.edu>`_.

Note, while there is an established list of Level 3 “add-ons” other specialized systems which must integrate into a classroom’s audio/video systems also qualify as Level 3 upgrades, these may be items such as microscope video systems etc. Please review the standard classroom levels when considering the submission of a classroom upgrade request.
