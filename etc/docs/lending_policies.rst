General Policies and Procedures
===============================

**We require a minimum of 48 hours notice on deliveries and pick-ups.**

Some of our equipment is in high demand throughout the semester. To insure availability of equipment and to inquire about the availability of delivery service, please contact us well in advance of the day that you need to it.

Everything that is delivered requires a signature from the patron. If you are not there when we arrive, we will wait a few minutes for you and then bring the items back so that we minimize the risk of theft by leaving it in an empty classroom. At that point, it will be your responsibility to come and pick the items up in LIB 003.

Also, please not that **we do not deliver to the Plaster Student Union**, unless it is to an office in that building.

Equipment can be picked up from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday - Friday. If you need to make weekend arrangements, please see the FAQ page about booking us for weekend events.

If the items you have checked out are stolen or are found damaged upon return, you will be assessed replacement costs for that item.

Faculty and Staff
=================

Reservation of equipment for pick-up or delivery can be done `on the web (click here) <equipment_request_forms.html>`_, by phone (836-5778), by fax (836-4554), or in person (LIB 202). We operate on a first-come, first-serve basis. The following information would be required when an order is placed:

* Name, department and phone number
* Equipment (hardware & software)
* Date and time equipment will be used
* Place where equipment is to be delivered
* Date and time of pick-up when finished

If you return the equipment in person, have your yellow copy signed by an ETC staff member as your receipt for returned equipment.

Please note:
------------

* Submitting the online form confirms that you have reviewed, agree to, and are responsible for the Equipment Lending policies followed by the ETC.  
* Submission of the online form does not guarantee the equipment availability; call the ETC to confirm if you do not receive an e-mail confirmation.

Student Policy
===============

Students and student organizations should contact the ETC office at 836-5778 regarding lending procedures since staff and/or faculty approval is required. Students are responsible for picking up and returning equipment borrowed.
