2010 Classroom Upgrade Process
==============================

Beginning April 1, 2009 and running through August 31, 2009 The Educational Technology Center and the Office of the Provost will be soliciting for classroom upgrade proposals for FY 2010. Because of the current economic environment, it is uncertain what, if any, funds will be available for infrastructure upgrade requests. Departments are encouraged to be realistic in the scope and number of requests submitted. Submitted proposals should ensure the greatest student impact in the classroom environment. Proposals are to be submitted for technology and/or infrastructure upgrades to classroom spaces only. Note that 30-days prior to the submission deadline, the Classroom Coordinator, David Caravella, must evaluate all proposals on location. 2009 Proposal forms are available `here </static/pdf/fy10cupform>`_. Those developing proposals or that have questions are encouraged to contact `David Caravella <mailto:davidcaravella@missouristate.edu>`_.
