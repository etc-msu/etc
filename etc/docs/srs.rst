September 25, 2006**Word of WARNING!**
The ETC was notified recently by a concerned parent that her son had been contacted via telephone by someone verifying his online eInstruction transaction. We were initially concerned that this could have been a `phishing <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/phishing.html>`_ scam but that was not the case.

This student had used a check to pay online which is now possible with some banks. It was not eInstruction who contacted the student, but rather, Telecheck, a national check verification company. Telecheck simply verified the student’s checking account and routing numbers (numbers they had and read back to him minus one digit) and no sensitive data was requested. This was a legitimate call from Telecheck, and there was no problem. However, because we were made aware of this incident, and initially feared the worst, we felt it would be wise to place a reminder on our site regarding release of sensitive information.

As with all dealings, students should take every measure possible to safeguard their sensitive data; social security numbers, credit card numbers etc. This data should only be released to known and verified entities. Also, as a reminder, eInstruction does not solicit financial or personal information from students via telephone or e-mail. Below is an e-mail statement from eInstruction’s President & CEO.

*Dear Missouri State students, faculty & staff,*
*eInstruction doesn’t keep credit card information on our servers and we instruct our tech support folks to never write down a credit card number if they are* *assisting a student.  Our policy is to never call a student to seek credit card information, but to have students call us if they need reimbursement of the* *enrollment code.*   | *Regards,* | *Darrell Ward, PhD* | *President and CEO, eInstruction Corporation* | *http://www.einstruction.com* | *888-707-6819*

| August 31, 2006| **Most Common SRS Problems**
| | While the implementation of the eInstruction Student Response System (SRS) on the Missouri State University campus this fall has gone smoothly, there have been several issues which have arisen that have a common theme. The problem solution chart below may assist you resolving some of the most common issues encountered.
|

| **Symptom**| Student’s transponder pads continually display “joining” but never join class session.
|
| **Possible Causes & Solutions**| **(No one in the class can join)**| **Cause:** Instructor forgot to choose correct class when starting polling.| **Solution:** Close CPS session, select question mode, select correct class from pull-down menu. 
|

| **Cause:** Receiver is unplugged or missing.| **Solution:** Trace USB ports and ensure that there is one going to the CPS receiver and that the unit is lit and displaying a red LED number. If receiver is there but not connected plug unto an available USB port. If the receiver is missing contact the ETC at 836-5778.
|
| **(Some students are unable to join the class, but others are)**
| **Cause:** Student(s) have not enrolled their transponders in your class.
| **Solution:** Ensure that students were given and used the correct class key code. Students then must go to the `eInstruction web site <http://www.einstruction.com/>`_
| select the “student” option at the top of the page, select Missouri State University from the pull-down menu and then log into their account and select “register for a class” NOTE: Many students believe that once they have registered their transponders that they completed the entire registration process, 
| this only creates their eInstruction account, they must then register their transponder in each class they will be using the system in using the class key code given to them by their instructors.
|

| **Cause:** Student may have a defective transponder pad.| **Solution:** Student should contact eInstruction technical support at 1-888-333-4988 for RMA. Students will then need to return their transponder pad and RMA form to the place of purchase for a new unit. NOTE: Students obtaining a replacement transponder pad MUST log into their eInstruction account and select “change” next to the serial number listed on their account, this will associate any classes which the defective transponder was registered in to the new transponder pad.

| **SRS & the Bookstore**
|| Mark Brixey, MSU Bookstore Director forwarded the following policy regarding returns of unused and defective SRS transponder pads “clickers”.| Any UNOPENED responder is eligible for a refund.| If the responder HAS been opened, but NO ATTEMPT has been made to ACTIVATE it, the responder is eligible for refund.| If the responder has been opened and the student had ANY trouble activating it, the STUDENT needs to call the Technical Support number.  If the responder is truly defective, the Tech Support folks will provide the student with a form to exchange it with us.  (We NEED the form to get credit for bad responders from the company so NO EXCHANGES without the form.)

The `Educational Technology Center (ETC) <http://etc0>`_ and `Computer Services <http://computerservices.missouristate.edu/>`_ has completed the final 
technical evaluation stage of the Student Response System (SRS) pilot program which was conducted on Campus during the spring ’06 semester. On March 13, 2006 | `Jeff Morrissey <JeffMorrissey@missouristate.edu>`_, Director of `Computer Services <http://computerservices.missouristate.edu/>`_ granted approval to deploy | the `eInstruction Radio frequency (RF) CPS SRS <http://www.einstruction.com/>`_ for the Fall '06 semester. This approval was granted on the condition that if these systems were to create a level of interference such that the Campus WiFi signal was degraded to an unacceptable level, that the `ETC <http://etc0>`_ and `Computer Services <http://computerservices.missouristate.edu/>`_ would have to re-evaluate these systems. While there is no doubt that RF SRS systems running at 2.4GHz will cause some interference, the levels monitored and experienced at other institutions who have done large scale deployment of the `eInstruction Radio frequency (RF) CPS SRS <http://www.einstruction.com/>`_ and that have far greater | WiFi coverage than MSU have indicated that the effect is negligible, as such, we do not expect any problem in the future. The `eInstruction <http://www.einstruction.com/>`_ system is now the "campus standard", and as such, is the only RF SRS in the 2.4GHz range that is authorized for use on the campus of Missouri State. All other 2.4GHz and 5 GHz devices must adhere to the university's policy regarding these frequencies below:
| *"The 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrum are institutional resources that must be governed appropriately. Administrators of wireless networks that use these radio frequencies must centrally register their network's frequency. Additionally, devices interfering with a wireless network may be disabled, upon review. This coordination helps minimize interference problems between wireless networks and other devices using radio frequencies."*
