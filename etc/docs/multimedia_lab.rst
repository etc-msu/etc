------------------------

The Multimedia lab offers a range of digital/media tools and capabilities intended to search, explore, evaluate, and construct instructional/informational resources.  This environment engages faculty, students, and other end-users in information inquiry, creative processes, and the exchange of knowledge and ideas.  The lab is designed to encourage teaching and learning opportunities and enhance the life-long learner (student) experience at Missouri State University. 
The lab has 9 Windows PCs and 18 Apple iMacs that allow patrons to do anything from the scanning and manipulation of documents/photos, to importing/recording/editing audio and video, to creating original works of digital art.


**Multimedia Lab Workstations**
--------------------------------------

**Flatbed scanners**

For documents or printed photography that need to be scanned for digital use, the multimedia lab has several Mac and Windows stations equipped with flatbed EPSON scanners. Content can then be touched up and edited as needed in Photoshop, or content can be scanned straight to a file without the need to use Photoshop.

  **Multimedia stations**

All Windows PCs and Macs in the Multimedia Lab are equipped to handle almost any audio or video format in use. If you have the need to create or view multimedia content, any of our stations are more than ready to handle that need.

	
**Digital editing stations** 

| There are several video editing stations in the Multimedia Lab.  Every Mac in the lab is equipped with Apple’s iMovie, and a subset of the Macs also have Apple’s more advanced Final Cut Studio for editing audio/video/DVD content. Stations are available for transfer to and from DVD, VHS, and digital formats. Specialized support can be provided with an appointment; contact the ETC Multimedia Lab Help Desk to set up an appointment.
|
  
**International format conversion stations** 

| Equipment for converting to and from NTSC and PAL video formats is also available for patron use. These stations also have specialized support if needed; contact the ETC Multimedia Lab Help Desk to set up an appointment.
|
  
**CD/DVD duplication stations** 

| If you need to get your CD or DVD content into the hands of a large group of people, there are stations available for mass duplication of non-copyrighted CDs and DVDs.
|

**Dubbing stations**

Stations are available for the simple transfer of DVD content to VHS, and vice-versa.

**Film/slide scanners**

If you prefer manual film photography to digital but still want the ability to touch up your content digitally, the Multimedia Lab has stations for the scanning of film and slide photography using Nikon scanners. The content can then be edited as needed using Adobe Photoshop.
