Classroom Upgrade Process
=========================

The Classroom Upgrade Process is an annual process involving million-dollar funding. It is a year long process coordinated by the Educational Technology Center that is based on proposals received from various departments in Missouri State University. The Upgrade proposals can be for technology and/or infrastructure upgrades. This process has campus-wide impact, which enhances instructional opportunities and learning experiences that directly support the university’s primary mission for developing, educated citizens. It’s perhaps one of the most comprehensive collaborative efforts involving all the academic departments and many administrative units across the university. 

* This process was formalized in 2002. It includes a 5-page document that defines all the tasks involved and timelines for completion.

* This is a year-long process which involves 3 main stages:

I)	Planning
II)	 Installation
III)	Maintenance, training & support

I)	Planning
----------------

Planning includes proposals developed with the Classroom Coordinator and each academic college. This involves opportunity for every academic department. The proposals are ranked in priority by the Dean. Then assignments based on funding are determined by the Classroom Upgrade Oversight Committee, CUOC. Project scope and cost estimates are developed by the units involved in the work, which includes Design & Construction, Facilities Maintenance, Telecommunication, and the ETC.

ETC evaluates all classroom technology in 4-year cycles to determine life cycle upgrades

II) Installs 
----------------

Installs occur when classrooms are available with the majority of projects occurring across the summer semester.

III) Maintenance, Training & Support
-------------------------------------

-	All systems are tested during/prior to punch list walk through
-	Training sessions are provided
-	Maintenance schedules are determined and fulfilled by ETC technicians
-	ETC oversees support issues and contact points
