The Educational Technology Center’s Classroom Coordinator, David Caravella, can assist you in developing the specifications for University technology purchases. Whether your request is part of the annual classroom upgrade process, or a departmentally funded project, David can provide insight into appropriate technology for your application and assist in coordination of other Campus resources. The ETC strives to provide this type of consultative service campus-wide; our staff has in-depth knowledge about media technology integration, and is happy to share such insight.
