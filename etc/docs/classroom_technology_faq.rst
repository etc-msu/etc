The Classroom Coordinator will sign off on the submission at that time, indicating that the initial consultation has occurred.

Most Common SRS Problems
------------------------

While the implementation of the eInstruction Student Response System (SRS) on the Missouri State University campus this fall has gone smoothly, there have been several issues which have arisen that have a common theme. The problem solution chart below may assist you resolving some of the most common issues encountered.

**Symptom**

Student’s transponder pads continually display “joining” but never join class session.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**

**(No one in the class can join)**

| **Cause:** Instructor forgot to choose correct class when starting polling.

**Solution:** Close CPS session, select question mode, select correct class from pull-down menu. 

| **Cause:** Receiver is unplugged or missing.

**Solution:** Trace USB ports and ensure that there is one going to the CPS receiver and that the unit is lit and displaying a red LED number. If receiver is there but not connected plug unto an available USB port. If the receiver is missing contact the ETC at 836-5778.

**(Some students are unable to join the class, but others are)**

| **Cause:** Student(s) have not enrolled their transponders in your class.

**Solution:** Ensure that students were given and used the correct class key code. Students then must go to the `eInstruction web site <http://www.einstruction.com/>`_, select the *student* option at the top of the page, select Missouri State University from the pull-down menu, and then log into their account and select *register for a class*. **NOTE**: Many students believe that once they have registered their transponders that they completed the entire registration process. This only creates their eInstruction account. They must then register their transponder in each class they will be using the system in using the class key code given to them by their instructors.

| **Cause:** Student may have a defective transponder pad.

**Solution:** Student should contact eInstruction technical support at 1-888-333-4988 for RMA. Students will then need to return their transponder pad and RMA form to the place of purchase for a new unit. NOTE: Students obtaining a replacement transponder pad MUST log into their eInstruction account and select “change” next to the serial number listed on their account, this will associate any classes which the defective transponder was registered in to the new transponder pad.
